1. Influencer Dashboard (Content Creator's Suite)The Influencer Dashboard is designed for the TikTok creator to manage the "Education Hub" and engage with her community anonymously.Layout & UI (Influencer)Primary View: A vertical sidebar for navigation and a main content area with HeroUI Tabs to switch between Videos, Quizzes, and Q&A.Content Feed: A grid of cards showing existing safety tips, with badges for status (e.g., Draft, Published, Scheduled).Key Features (Influencer)FeatureTechnical ImplementationMedia UploaderDrag-and-drop zone using HeroUI Modal. Videos are uploaded to the Appwrite Education bucket.Quiz BuilderA form to create "Choose Your Adventure" safety scenarios stored in the Quizzes database collection.Q&A InboxA moderated list of incoming anonymous questions. She can reply with a text response or a voice note.Engagement StatsSimple metrics (Views, Saves) fetched from Appwrite Databases to show impact.2. SuperAdmin Portal (The Control Center)The SuperAdmin portal is for you (the Tech Lead) to maintain the platform's integrity, verify organizations, and monitor system health.Layout & UI (Admin)High-Security Dashboard: Uses HeroUI Table components with server-side pagination for high-volume data like the NGO directory.System Monitoring: Integrated charts showing anonymous session growth and database uptime.Key Features (Admin)NGO Verification: A dedicated screen to review, approve, or update the Local Support Directory.Influencer Management: Assign/Revoke the influencer label to users so they can access the content creator tools.Audit Logs: A read-only feed of administrative actions (e.g., "Admin X updated AWSAD phone number") to ensure transparency.Global Kill Switch: A prominent button to put the Portal (but not the Camouflage) into "Maintenance Mode" if a vulnerability is detected.3. Data Flow & Permissions (The "Security Bridge")To prevent data leaks, we use Appwrite Teams and Labels.Influencer Label: Grants read and create access to the Videos and Questions collections.Admin Label: Grants full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) access to all collections and storage buckets.Public/Anonymous: Restricted to read-only access for published content and create-only for their own evidence vault entries.Implementation Pattern: Dashboard SidebarTypeScript// AI Agent: Use HeroUI Listbox for the sidebars
import { Listbox, ListboxItem } from "@heroui/react";

export const AdminSidebar = () => (
  <Listbox aria-label="Admin Actions">
    <ListboxItem key="stats">Platform Overview</ListboxItem>
    <ListboxItem key="ngos">Manage Support Directory</ListboxItem>
    <ListboxItem key="users" color="warning">Influencer Access</ListboxItem>
  </Listbox>
);
4. Requirement for AI AgentWhen building these dashboards:Use HeroUI Skeleton loaders during Appwrite data fetching to prevent UI "jank."Implement Optimistic UI (using React useOptimistic) so the Influencer sees their post "Upload" immediately while the background sync finishes.Ensure all forms have Validation (using Zod or Yup) before hitting the Appwrite API.
